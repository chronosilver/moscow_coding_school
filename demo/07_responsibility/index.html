            <h2>Meta Side Table</h2>
            <p>
              The Meta Side Table is one of our signature pieces and well suited
              to all communal living spaces and bedrooms. Consisting of a series
              of arranged, powder coated rectangular and circular shapes, Meta’s
              appearance changes from delicate and thin, to substantial and full
              depending on the viewing angle. Featuring multi-directional storage
              for your reading material and an even top for decorative
              accessories.

            <h2>Click Shelf</h2>
            <p >
              Click is a boltless shelving system. The minimalistic form and
              construction, as well as the visual lightness, form the aesthetic
              characteristics of the shelf. Constructed of 1.5mm thin sheet steel,
              a girder and shelves, the system functions similar to a construction
              kit. Only four screws fix the girder together to which the shelves
              are simply hung up without any tools. The material and precision of
              the components guarantee the stability and assembly.

            <h2>Float Shelf</h2>
            <p >
              Designed as a versatile storage option, the Float Shelf is open to
              diverse interpretations – holding a book as a bedside or side table,
              bearing weight as wall console, storing a magazine collection,
              serving as a compact standing desk, or safeguarding small personal
              essentials as a hallway tray. The Float Shelf equally adds a touch
              of character to hotel rooms, boutique accommodation and
              boardinghouses. Embodying purity at its most elegant degree, the
              strict geometry of this wall-mounted shelf lends its form a
              sculptural appeal. The Float Shelf consists of two offset levels cut
              from a single sheet of aluminum, with a simple two-fold composition
              allowing for flexible placement, use and display. Referencing the
              reduced aesthetic principles of modernism in the Bauhaus tradition,
              its design distils the essence of a shelf.
