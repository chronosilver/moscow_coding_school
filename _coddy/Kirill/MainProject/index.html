            Max Weber was a Jewish-American painter and one of the first
            American Cubist painters who, in later life, turned to more
            figurative Jewish themes in his art. He is best known today for
            Chinese Restaurant (1915), in the collection of the Whitney Museum
            of American Art, "the finest canvas of his Cubist phase," in the
            words of art historian Avis Berman.

            Born in the Polish city of Białystok, then part of the Russian
            Empire, Weber emigrated to the United States and settled in Brooklyn
            with his Orthodox Jewish parents at the age of ten. He studied art
            at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn under Arthur Wesley Dow. Dow was
            a fortunate early influence on Weber as he was an "enlightened and
            vital teacher" in a time of conservative art instruction, a man who
            was interested in new approaches to creating art. Dow had met Paul
            Gauguin in Pont-Aven, was a devoted student of Japanese art, and
            defended the advanced modernist painting and sculpture he saw at the
            Armory Show in New York in 1913

            In 1905, after teaching in Virginia and Minnesota, Weber had saved
            enough money to travel to Europe, where he studied at the Académie
            Julian in Paris and acquainted himself with the work of such
            modernists as Henri Rousseau (who became a good friend), Henri
            Matisse, Pablo Picasso, and other members of the School of Paris.
            His friends among fellow Americans included some equally adventurous
            young painters, such as Abraham Walkowitz, H. Lyman Sayen, and
            Patrick Henry Bruce. Avant-garde France in the years immediately
            before World War I was fertile and welcoming territory for Weber,
            then in his early twenties. He arrived in Paris in time to see a
            major Cézanne exhibition, meet the poet Guillaume Apollinaire,
            frequent Gertrude Stein's salon, and enroll in classes in Matisse's
            private "Academie." Rousseau gave him some of his works; others,
            Weber purchased. He was responsible for Rousseau's first exhibition
            in the United States
